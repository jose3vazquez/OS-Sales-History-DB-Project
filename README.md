# OS Sales History ‚Äî SQL Insights Project

This project analyzes historical sales data of various Microsoft Operating Systems across different regions, years, and sales channels. 

The dataset resides in an Azure SQL Database and is queried using SQL Server Management Studio / Azure Data Studio.

## üîç SQL Queries and Insights

### 1. Top 1000 Rows Preview
**Purpose:** Retrieve a quick look at the raw data to verify structure and completeness.
```sql
   SELECT TOP (1000) *
   FROM dbo.os_sales_hist;
```

### 2. Top Performing OS by Total Revenue
**Question:** Which operating systems generated the highest total revenue?
 ```sql
    SELECT TOP 3 
        product_name, 
        SUM(total_revenue) AS total_revenue_generated
    FROM dbo.os_sales_hist
    GROUP BY product_name
    ORDER BY total_revenue_generated DESC;
```

### 3. Year-over-Year Sales Trend
**Question:** What are the total units sold each year?
```sql
   SELECT 
       YEAR(sales_date) AS year,
       SUM(units_sold) AS total_units_sold
   FROM dbo.os_sales_hist
   GROUP BY YEAR(sales_date)
   ORDER BY year ASC;
```

### 4. Regional Performance Breakdown
**Question:** What is the total revenue by sales region?
```sql
   SELECT 
     region,
     SUM(total_revenue) AS total_revenue
   FROM dbo.os_sales_hist
   GROUP BY region
   ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### 5. Channel Profitability Comparison
**Question:** Which distribution channel generated the most revenue?
```sql
   SELECT 
       channel,
       SUM(total_revenue) AS revenue_by_channel
   FROM dbo.os_sales_hist
   GROUP BY channel
   ORDER BY revenue_by_channel DESC;
   ```
